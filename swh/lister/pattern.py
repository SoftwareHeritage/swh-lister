class Lister(Generic[StateType, PageType]):
    """The base class for a Software Heritage lister.

    A lister scrapes a page by page list of origins from an upstream (a forge, the API
    of a package manager, ...), and massages the results of that scrape into a list of
    origins that are recorded by the scheduler backend.

    The main loop of the lister, :meth:`run`, basically revolves around the
    :meth:`get_pages` iterator, which sets up the lister state, then yields the scrape
    results page by page. The :meth:`get_origins_from_page` method converts the pages
    into a list of :class:`model.ListedOrigin`, sent to the scheduler at every page. The
    :meth:`commit_page` method can be used to update the lister state after a page of
    origins has been recorded in the scheduler backend.

    The :func:`finalize` method is called at lister teardown (whether the run has
    been successful or not) to update the local :attr:`state` object before it's sent to
    the database. This method must set the :attr:`updated` attribute if an updated
    state needs to be sent to the scheduler backend. This method can call
    :func:`get_state_from_scheduler` to refresh and merge the lister state from the
    scheduler before it's finalized (and potentially minimize the risk of race
    conditions between concurrent runs of the lister).

    The state of the lister is serialized and deserialized from the dict stored in the
    scheduler backend, using the :meth:`state_from_dict` and :meth:`state_to_dict`
    methods.

    Args:
      scheduler: the instance of the Scheduler being used to register the
        origins listed by this lister
      url: a URL representing this lister, e.g. the API's base URL
      instance: the instance name used, in conjunction with :attr:`LISTER_NAME`, to
        uniquely identify this lister instance.
      credentials: dictionary of credentials for all listers. The first level
        identifies the :attr:`LISTER_NAME`, the second level the lister
        :attr:`instance`. The final level is a list of dicts containing the
        expected credentials for the given instance of that lister.

    Generic types:
      - *StateType*: concrete lister type; should usually be a :class:`dataclass` for
        stricter typing
      - *PageType*: type of scrape results; can usually be a :class:`requests.Response`,
        or a :class:`dict`
